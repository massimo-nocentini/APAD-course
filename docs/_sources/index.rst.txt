APAD course's content
=====================

This booklet support part of the course
https://e-l.unifi.it/course/view.php?id=13262 about *Algorithms for Programming
and Analysis of Data*, taught at the University of Florence.

It is based on https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/ and the
content taken from there, both text and code, is reported unchanged to respect
the original author's license and I deserve no merits for it. The other stuff
(mainly the introduction and the last two chapters) are of mine, so blame me
for errors occurring there.

On one hand, a set of slides can be used for presenting

.. hlist::
   :columns: 3

   * `Introduction <../../../ipynbs/introduction.slides.html>`_
   * `Jupyter notebooks <../../../ipynbs/jupyter-notebooks.slides.html>`_
   * `numpy <../../../ipynbs/numpy.slides.html>`_
   * `pandas <../../../ipynbs/pandas.slides.html>`_
   * `matplotlib <../../../ipynbs/matplotlib.slides.html>`_
   * `networkx <../../../ipynbs/networkx.slides.html>`_
   * `Gotchas <../../../ipynbs/gotchas.slides.html>`_
   * `Generators <../../../ipynbs/generators.slides.html>`_

On the other hand, the content can be read according to the TOC
